# elm-todo

A very simple TODO list app that i built to learn more about [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

## Pre-requirements

After install Elm, clone this repo:

```
https://github.com/williamrozin/elm-todo.git
```

Go to the project path:

```
cd ./elm-todo
```

And run:

```
elm reactor
```

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm](http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm)

## Building the app

If you want to build the app, just run the command below:

```
elm make src/Main.elm --output=build/index.html
